## Introduction
This project is a rock-paper-scissors game with 2 playable modes. One mode is the classic 3 way rock paper scissors and the other is a 5 way variation. Instead of the typical options of rock, paper, or scissors, I changed the options to different Turing instructors. To avoid accusations of bias in deciding which of my instructors would defeat other instructors, I decided to mix up each instructor's face with another. When the user selects their choice, the "computer" player selects another option randomly.

## Features
- Users can choose between two game modes: classic and variation
- Users can select between 3 "fighter" options in classic mode and 5 "fighter" options in variation mode.
- Each fighter has an equal chance of winning or losing to the computer.
- Both the user's and computer's wins are saved and displayed on the page. The total number of wins will persist on page load due to local storage
